# Generic Testbed Configuration
#

# This configuration uses IP blocks intended for documentation as
# examples and will not result in a functioning VM because they are
# unlikely to be able to reach the Internet.

# eth0 is the NAT interface.  Don't configure that.

# Note that the global default route will be on the first of these
# interfaces if it has a default route configured.  Othewise, any
# VMs created based on this testbed will have no default route.

eth1:                               # Interface on guest
  bridge: p3p1                      # Bridge to this interface on the host
  ip:
    4:
      block: 192.0.2.0/24           # IPv4 network block
      default: 192.0.2.1            # IPv4 default gateway
      base: 2                       # First host in block to use
    6:
      block: 2001:0db8:0001::/65    # IPv6 network block
      default: 2001:0db8:0001::1    # IPv6 default gateway
      base: 2                       # First host in block to use

eth2:
  bridge: p3p2
  ip:
    # No IPv4 on this interface.
    6:
      block: 2001:0db8:0002::/65
      default: 2001:0db8:0002::1
      base: 2
